Abstract

   Sheffer et al. published [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] on 9th
   January, 2025 and despite being wildly out of scope of SEAT charter,
   the draft made its place -- getting two-thirds of meeting time -- in
   the agenda for upcoming SEAT interim meeting within hours of
   publishing.  In comparison, our request to present
   [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] fully within the charter was refused.  In
   this document, we disprove the claim made in
   [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] for backward compatibility with
   standard TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].  We argue that
   [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] is a much more reaonsable way of achieving
   the goal within the scope of SEAT charter.

1.  Introduction

   We argue that:

   *  [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] is out of scope of SEAT WG
      charter.

   *  Several claims in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] are broken.
      Specifically, we prove that proposed key schedule is inconsistent
      with [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   *  [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] breaks most -- if not all --
      proofs done to date for TLS 1.3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Out of Scope

   [SEAT-Charter] has:

   |  The attested (D)TLS protocol extension will not modify the (D)TLS
   |  protocol itself.  It may define (D)TLS extensions to support its
   |  goals but will not modify, add, or remove any existing protocol
   |  messages or modify the key schedule.

   Contrary to the crystal clear statement of scope:

   *  Section 4.1 of [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] adds a new
      protocol message named "Attestation".

   *  Section 5.6 of [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] modifies the
      key schedule.

   Both are subtle and error-prone.  Such intesive changes should not
   bypass FATT process at TLS WG by any means.  SEAT has just a mention
   of formal analysis in its charter and no real process.  SEAT also
   does not have the blessing of many TLS experts.  It makes pursuing
   such a work in SEAT almost surely to lead to failure.  We recommend
   the authors of [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] to submit the
   draft to TLS WG, where such changes are in scope.

3.1.  Comparison with our draft

   In comparison, [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] makes no changes to TLS and
   is fully in scope of SEAT charter.

4.  Broken Claims

   Too many claims in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] are broken.
   We present one example which invalidates most of other claims.  The
   key schedule proposed in Section 5.6 of
   [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] is not consistent with
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   Using notations from [Key-Schedule]:

   hs = HKDF-Extract(salt1,gxy)

   whereas this draft proposes:

   hs' = HKDF-Extract(0,gxy)

4.1.  Proof

   Using definition of salt1 [Key-Schedule]:

   salt1 != 0

   Therefore, it comes that:

   hs != hs'

   Hence, the key schedule in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] is
   inconsistent with [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

4.2.  Comparison with our draft

   In comparison, [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] uses standard TLS key
   schedule without any changes.

5.  Breaking Formal Proofs

   Because of above key schedule change, the draft breaks most -- if not
   all -- proofs done to date for TLS 1.3.

5.1.  Comparison with our draft

   In comparison, we are making a careful effort to preserve security
   properties for our draft [I-D.fossati-seat-expat].

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft helps make this world more secure by refuting the security
   claims in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] and by pushing against
   disruption of FATT process of TLS WG.  Security is dependent on
   weakest link and we believe [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] is
   the weakest link in the security of TLS.  Hence, we view post-
   handshake attestation as the most appropriate option.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   We thank the authors of [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] for
   putting together something, which is already long overdue.

   Since the proof in Section 4.1 is based on the working done in
   [Key-Schedule], we thank all those acknowledged there: namely Arto
   Niemi, Hannes Tschofenig, Thomas Fossati, Eric Rescorla, and Ionut
   Mihalcea
